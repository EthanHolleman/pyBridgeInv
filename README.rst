PyBridgeInv
===========

**Py**thon **Bridge** **Inv**entory

The [National Bridge Inventory](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi.cfm) 
collects data on all bridges in the United
States and makes that data publicly available as has since 1997.

Repositories are available for basic parsing of this data 
([iandees repo](https://github.com/iandees/national-bridge-inventory) comes
up with a quick search) but only include code for parsing basic attributes
like latitude, longitude and dates.

The goal of PyBridgeInv is to create a Python package to exhaustively parse
all fields present in NBI data files.
