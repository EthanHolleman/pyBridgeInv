Code;Description
N;Bridge not over waterway.
U;"Bridge with ""unknown"" foundation that has not been evaluated for
scour. Since risk cannot be determined, flag for monitoring during
flood events and, if appropriate, closure."
T;"Bridge over ""tidal"" waters that has not been evaluated for scour,
but considered low risk. Bridge will be monitored with regular
inspection cycle and with appropriate underwater inspections.
(""Unknown"" foundations in ""tidal"" waters should be coded U.)"
9;"Bridge foundations (including piles) on dry land well above flood
water elevations."
8;"Bridge foundations determined to be stable for assessed or
calculated scour conditions; calculated scour is above top of
footing. (Example A)"
7;"Countermeasures have been installed to correct a previously existing
problem with scour. Bridge is no longer scour critical."
6;"Scour calculation/evaluation has not been made. (Use only to
describe case where bridge has not yet been evaluated for scour
potential.)"
5;"Bridge foundations determined to be stable for calculated scour
conditions; scour within limits of footing or piles. (Example B)"
4;"Bridge foundations determined to be stable for calculated scour
conditions; field review indicates action is required to protect
exposed foundations from effects of additional erosion and
corrosion."
3;"Bridge is scour critical; bridge foundations determined to be
unstable for calculated scour conditions:
- Scour within limits of footing or piles. (Example B)
- Scour below spread-footing base or pile tips. (Example C)"
2;"Bridge is scour critical; field review indicates that extensive
scour has occurred at bridge foundations. Immediate action is
required to provide scour countermeasures."
1;"Bridge is scour critical; field review indicates that failure of
piers/abutments is imminent. Bridge is closed to traffic."
0;"Bridge is scour critical.
